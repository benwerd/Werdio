	<p>
	  <a href="https://19thnews.org/">The 19th</a> is a diverse, women-led newsroom that reports at the intersection of gender, politics,
	  and policy in the US. It was one of the only newsrooms to call the election correctly because it listened to women and particularly
	  women of color. It provides important representation for vulnerable communities who have been underserved by the media. And it needs
	  your help.
	</p>
        <p>
          It's a non-profit that is making a big impact with few resources. As little as $5 could make a huge difference in this reporting.
